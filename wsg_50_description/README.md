# Schunk WSG50 Meshes

All files under `./meshes` were converted from the original CAD files
downloaded from the Schunk's website on WSG 050-110-P model:
https://schunk.com/us_en/gripping-systems/product/44042-0306122-wsg-050-110-p/

The original CAD files were modified to simplify geometry, and some details
such as mounting holes have been deleted.

The `.obj` files were converted in Blender from `.stl` files, which were
exported from Solidworks using the original CAD files.
